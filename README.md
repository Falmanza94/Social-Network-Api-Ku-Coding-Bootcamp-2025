# Social Network API

## Description

My task is to make a backend API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Built from scratch using **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**, this API handles unstructured data efficiently using NoSQL principles.

It features full CRUD functionality for **users**, **thoughts**, **reactions**, and **friendships**, and is tested with **Insomnia**.
